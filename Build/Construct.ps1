# 🔴 `Module.toml` is the authority and this script derives the graph from it. The array that used to sit
#    here restated the same facts in a second place, and two statements of one graph are two things to keep
#    agreeing — `SlateUI` had carried four requirements it did not use for exactly as long as nothing read
#    the manifests.
#
# 🔴 Two DIFFERENT facts are read, and conflating them is the mistake this arrangement exists to prevent:
#      [requires].unit  — what a unit may **include**. Enforced by `Scripts/VerifyPartition.ps1`.
#      [link].unit      — what an executable must **link**, most-dependent first.
#    They coincide for most units and part for `SlateUI`, which links four archives and includes none.
#
# 📝 Translation order is a topological sort of `[link].unit`, because a unit's archive must exist before
#    anything that links it. `[requires]` cannot order the build: `SlateUI` requires nothing and must still
#    be translated last of the libraries.
