#============================================================================================================================================
# 🧩 Runs Build/Construct.ps1's sequence on a POSIX/g++ box — same steps, same order, syntax-only translation.

# 🔴 This exists so an agent working on Linux reaches the SAME refusals a Windows build reaches, in the SAME
#    order. The divergence this removes was concrete: work done here skipped ApplyImGuiPatches and compiled a
#    hand-listed subset of SlateUI, so `ImGuiStyle::TabSlant` was never missing here and the partition was
#    never checked at all — both then failed on the Windows build. The ordering below is Construct.ps1's:
#
#       1. read the unit graph from Module.toml       (Read-UnitGraph)
#       2. refuse a duplicate subject                 (Test-SubjectUniqueness)
#       3. topologically order the units              (Resolve-TranslationOrder, Kahn)
#       4. apply the ImGui divergence                 (ApplyImGuiPatches.ps1)   ← the step that was missed
#       5. prove the dependency partition             (VerifyPartition.ps1)
#       6. translate every unit in dependency order   (Invoke-Translation)
#
# ⚠️ This is NOT a replacement for Construct.ps1 and it does not link, archive or lower shaders. MSVC is the
#    only toolchain that builds Slate for real; g++ -fsyntax-only is a front-end proxy that catches the class
#    of defect an agent actually introduces — a missing include, a renamed member, a broken declaration.
#    A clean run here means "nothing obviously refuses", not "the Windows build is green".
