//============================================================================================================================================
// 🧩 The floating tool-options panel — a draggable card of controls for the active tool, collapsing to a
//    pill that still names what it holds.
//
// 📐 Built to `References/ToolOptionsWidget.html`. The reference declares exactly four kinds of control —
//    a slider, a segmented option, a toggle and a colour bar — and every tool's options are a table of
//    them. That is the whole grammar, so it is the whole grammar here: a widget that grew a fifth kind
//    per tool would be five widgets wearing one name.
//
// 🔴 SELECT AND THE GIZMO ARE ONE WIDGET, NOT TWO. They are one thing an artist does — choose something,
//    then move it — and splitting them would put the gizmo's visibility switch in a panel the artist has
//    to go and find while the thing they want to move is already selected.
//
// 🔴 THE COLLAPSED FORM IS A PILL, NOT A BUBBLE. The reference collapses to a 56 px round bubble showing
//    only an icon, which says nothing about which tool's options are inside it. The pill keeps the title
//    and a chevron, so a collapsed widget still answers the question it exists to answer.
