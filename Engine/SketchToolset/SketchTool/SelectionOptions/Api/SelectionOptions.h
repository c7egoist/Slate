// 🧩 What the Select tool is currently willing to pick, and how forgivingly. The floating tool-options
//    widget edits this; the picker reads it. Nothing here draws, and nothing here knows a widget exists.
//
// 🔴 THE ARTIST ASKED FOR SPECIFIC SELECTION. The picker offered whatever happened to be nearest — a
//    curve, its endpoint or a Bezier handle, whichever won on distance — so reaching for an edge when a
//    vertex sat near it was a matter of luck and zoom. An element mode makes the request explicit: with
//    `Vertex` standing, a curve is not a candidate at all, however close the pointer falls to it.

/// note  🔴 Five modes, each mapping onto what a sketch actually HAS and named the way an artist names it:
///          Vertex → an endpoint or a Bezier control handle (Point, Control)
///          Edge   → a curve between them (Curve)
///          Face   → a closed region the curves bound (Record)
///          Object → the whole shape or profile, however it was reached
///          Free   → whatever is nearest, whichever kind it turns out to be
/// note  🔴 `Free` WAS DELIBERATELY ABSENT AND IS NOW DELIBERATELY PRESENT. It was withheld because
///        "pick whatever is nearest" was the original defect — reaching for an edge and getting a vertex
///        because the vertex happened to be closer. That is only a defect when it is the ONLY behaviour.
///        As one mode among five, chosen deliberately, it is the fast path an artist wants when the
///        sketch is sparse and there is nothing to disambiguate. The defect was the absence of a choice,
///        not the existence of this behaviour.
/// note  📝 `Object` and `Face` differ in what they RETURN, not in what they hit. Face reports the region
///        under the pointer; Object reports the whole record that region belongs to, which is what the
///        artist means by "select the shape". They resolve alike when a record holds one profile.
