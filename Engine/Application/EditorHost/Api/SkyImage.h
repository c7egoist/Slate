// 🧩 Generates the editor viewport's sky image from the CPU atmosphere integrator.
//
//    The three resident surfaces (transmittance, multiple scattering, sky view)
//    are direction-indexed: sampling the sky-view surface at a view direction
//    yields the atmosphere's single + multiple scattered radiance along it. This
//    generator evaluates that model per output texel on a direction-indexed dome —
//    the azimuth across the width, the elevation down the height — and adds the
//    sun's direct disc, exactly as the GPU `SkyViewSurface.slang` entry point does
//    on the device: the same model, one texture the windowed hosts upload through
//    the sampled-image path. The viewport crops the dome to its camera's field of
//    view, so the sun stays in frame at any viewport aspect.
