// 📝 One host source, several products. `Engine/Application/Module.toml`'s [product] table names one
//    feature macro per product and `Build/Construct.ps1` supplies it as /D. This header reads that macro
//    and is the ONLY place that does — a second reader is a second statement of what a product contains.
//
// 🔴 The predecessor of this header declared the same masks, was never handed a macro by the build, and
//    was never read by any caller. Both ends were dead, so an agent looking for the live mechanism
//    correctly concluded there was none and wrote its own camera, sky and CAD editor. The #error below
//    is what makes that failure impossible to repeat: a build that forgets the macro does not produce a
//    featureless host, it produces a diagnostic naming this file.
