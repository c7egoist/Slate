// ⚠️ **SKELETON.** This header declares the texturing tool VOCABULARY and deliberately nothing else. There
//    is no placement machine here yet, and adding one now would be guesswork: the sketch equivalent was
//    only correct because it was written against a 5 981-line host that already showed what the machine
//    had to do, and no comparable reading of the texturing host has been done.
//
// 🔴 What already exists, and must NOT be restated here when this unit grows:
//      • `SlateCompute/Compute/ImpressionSequence` — `StrokeDeclaration`, `ImpressionSample`,
//        `StrokeArrival`, `SealedStroke`. Stroke accumulation, deferral and the bounded inverse.
//      • `SlateCompute/Compute/EmissionSequence`   — texel emission and sealing.
//      • the texturing panel in `SlateUI/Interface/` — the artist's brush controls and layer stack.
//    A texturing tool DECLARES against those; it does not reimplement them. The one thing none of them
//    answers is which tool the artist is currently holding and what that tool means, which is why this
//    file exists and why it is this short.
//
// 📝 Declared now rather than when it is needed, for one reason learned on the sketch side: a vocabulary
//    with no owner gets declared twice. `SharedCadDraftSubject` and `ParametricDraftSubject` were the same
//    twenty-two members in two files, reconciled by casting through the underlying integer, and no
//    validator noticed for as long as they both existed. Naming the owner before the second copy is
//    written costs one file; unifying two copies afterwards cost a full step.

///        painting, stencilling or masking is presentation. `SymbolDiscipline::Texturing` spells it so.
/// note  📝 These are the operations `ImpressionSequence` can already carry — the enumeration names them,
///        it does not add them. A member is added here only when the compute side can honour it, which is
///        the rule the sketch side broke by offering `DiameterCircle` before anything could commit one.

///        abandoned. `Continuous` is the ordinary brush — it runs while the contact is held. `Anchored`
