// 🧩 Where a running executable finds things: its shaders beside the binary, the artist's home directory,
//    and what the content browser should show when it is pointed at a folder.
//
// 🔴 ALL THREE WERE DEFINED TWICE — ONCE IN `EditorHost` AND ONCE IN `ParametricSketchHost` — AND TWO OF
//    THE PAIRS HAD ALREADY DRIFTED. `ShaderStreamDirectory` differed only in whitespace, but
//    `PopulateImportDirectory` did not: the parametric host recognised mesh and material-image files and
//    the editor host did not, so the SAME folder listed different importable files depending on which
//    executable opened it. Neither copy was wrong on its own; having two is what made them disagree.
//
// 📝 This is genuinely a runtime concern rather than a workspace one — it does not vary between texturing
//    and sketching, and it is fixed for the life of the process.
