/// 🧩 Constructs the five lifetimes in `32` §1's order, recovers them, and unwinds them in the exact reverse.

///        the same teardown, and the three copies had drifted. the texturing host never tested `ExtentAltered`, so
///        resizing did nothing until the vendor rejected; it left the tick loop on a rejected present rather
///        than re-establishing the chain; and it opened its command recording **before** building the
///        interface tick, so five of its escape paths returned to the top of the loop with a command buffer
///        still recording and a display image still acquired. A second windowed host had none of those, and
///        the only thing separating the two was which copy a reader happened to edit.
/// note  📝 That second host was `EditorHost`, and once this component held the bring-up it was byte-identical
///        to the texturing host but for its name and window caption. `32` §3 ships two hosts — texturing and the
///        headless `ConsoleHost` — and named it in neither, so it was retired rather than left as a second
///        copy of one program waiting to drift again.
/// note  🔴 ⏱️ The ordering that prevents the whole class of defect is stated once, here: **every refusal
///        that can occur is resolved before the display image is acquired**. After `Await` reports
///        `Recording`, there is no path in this component that returns without submitting — so a host
///        cannot leave a recording open, because it never holds one across a decision.
/// note  ⚠️ A host owns its own content and this component owns none of it. What crosses is a command
