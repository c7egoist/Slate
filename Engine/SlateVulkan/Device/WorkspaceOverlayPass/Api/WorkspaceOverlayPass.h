//============================================================================================================================================
// 🧩 The editor overlay's own GPU pass — the grid, the gizmo and (later) wireframe
//    drawn by a dedicated graphics program in a pass of their own, instead of
//    through the interface's ImGui draw lists.
//
//    🔴 WHY A SEPARATE PASS. The interface records everything through ImGui, which
//       tessellates every polyline on the CPU and blends premultiplied alpha —
//       a dense lattice or a high-poly wireframe bogged the frame down, and a
//       low-alpha line over a bright sky read washed out. This pass consumes the
//       CPU-side `OverlayGeometry` record (a few hundred primitives), uploads it
//       when its generation changes, expands lines and dots in the VERTEX SHADER
//       (two CPU points per line, one per dot), and blends straight alpha with no
//       tone mapping — vivid colours, and the CPU never tessellates.
//
//    The pass records INSIDE the host's dynamic-rendering scope, after the
//    interface: the host calls `Record` between `BeginRendering` and `Complete`.
//    It is self-contained — its own pipeline, layout, descriptor set and buffer —
//    following `AtmospherePresentationSurface`'s precedent of owning its objects directly.
