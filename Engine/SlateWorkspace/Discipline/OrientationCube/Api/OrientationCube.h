//============================================================================================================================================
// 🧩 The orientation widget in the corner of a viewport: a labelled cube in CAD mode, a ball of axis
//    handles otherwise. It shows which way the view is facing and lets the artist snap to a face.
//
// 🔴 LIFTED OUT OF `Application/Api/SharedViewportHostBridge.h`, WHICH ALL THREE HOSTS INCLUDED. It was
//    472 lines of `inline` in a header shared by executables — every host compiled its own copy, and a
//    header under `Application/` is reachable by nothing else, so no unit and no test could ever draw or
//    hit-test the widget. That header is deleted at step 11; this is where its one real behaviour lives.
//
// 🔴 THE DUPLICATE ORIENTATION ENUMERATION IS GONE. `SharedViewportOrientation` named the same seven
//    directions as `ViewportOrientation` in different words (`Iso` against `Isometric`) and with an extra
//    `None` member that existed only to mean "the pointer hit nothing". Two enumerations for one idea is
//    how a conversion switch gets written, and the host had one. A miss is now a refusal, which is what
//    it always was.
