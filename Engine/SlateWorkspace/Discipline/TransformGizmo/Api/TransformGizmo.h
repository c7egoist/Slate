//
// 🔴 A GIZMO IS A SCREEN-SPACE OBJECT. It is a constant size in pixels however far the camera stands off,
//    because it is a control, not part of the drawing. An arrow the artist can no longer hit after zooming
//    out is a broken control; an arrow that swallows the whole viewport after zooming in is worse.
//
// ⚠️ THE HOST HAD THE HIT TEST AND THE DRAWING MEASURED IN DIFFERENT UNITS. `ResolveGizmoHandle` tested a
//    44-PIXEL axis while `RecordViewportGizmo` drew a 78-WORLD-UNIT shaft with a cone out at 102 and a
//    scale box at 94, then projected them. Those agree at exactly one zoom level and nowhere else:
//
//        OrthoScale   drawn shaft      hit-test reach
//        0.5           39 px            44 px          (near enough)
//        1.0           78 px            44 px
//        4.0          312 px            44 px          the arrow is seven times longer than its hit box
//        32.0        2496 px            44 px          the arrow crosses the display; only its root grabs
//
//    Zoomed in, the artist grabs empty space near the pivot and gets the arrow; zoomed out, the arrow is
//    smaller than its own hit box and clicking beside it still grabs. The measurements below are the ONE
//    table both halves read, in pixels, so the two cannot drift apart again.
//
// 📝 The drawing converts each pixel measurement to world at the pivot through `WorldPerPixel`, so the
//    projected result comes back the size the table asked for.
