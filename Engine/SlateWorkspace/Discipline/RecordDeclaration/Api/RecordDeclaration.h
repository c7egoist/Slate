// 🧩 Writing a sketched thing into the workspace directory: a curve, a closed profile, a dimension, a
//    constraint or a point, each filed under the folder its category belongs to and named by the index.
//
// 🔴 These five were separate functions in the host that differed only in three places — which subject the
//    record carries, which category folder it is filed under, and which payload member is set. Everything
//    else, including the folder lookup and the naming, was repeated verbatim five times.
//
// 📝 Kept as five named entry points rather than collapsed into one call taking a subject. The payload
//    member differs per subject and a single entry point would need a variant or five optional arguments,
//    which is a worse statement of the same thing: a caller declaring a dimension should not be able to
//    hand over a curve. The repetition that actually mattered — the folder lookup — is now written once.
