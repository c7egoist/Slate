//============================================================================================================================================
// 🧩 Turning a sealed placement into declared geometry, a named record and one revision.
//
// 🔴 A SEALED PLACEMENT IS ANSWERED BY EXACTLY ONE ARM, CHOSEN BY SUBJECT **AND** METHOD TOGETHER.
//
//    The host chose by walking a twenty-arm `if` chain in source order, and most arms tested only the
//    subject. An arm written for `Circle` with no method test therefore caught a CENTRED circle before
//    the chain ever reached the arm meant for it, and the artist got the wrong shape with no refusal and
//    no message. Nine of the twenty-seven accepted combinations reached an arm not written for them:
//
//        Arc Centred, Arc Tangent, Arc ThreePoint   -> the bare Arc arm, built as a 3-point arc
//        Circle Centred                             -> the bare Circle arm, built as centre-and-radius
//        Ellipse Centred, Ellipse Diameter          -> the bare Ellipse arm
//        EllipticalArc Centred, ~ ThreePoint        -> the bare EllipticalArc arm
//        Polygon Centred                            -> the bare Polygon arm
//
//    Worse than a wrong answer, the arm written for a centred arc was UNREACHABLE — 24 lines of dead
//    code that looked like a working feature. `Tangent` had no implementation reachable at all.
//
//    The dispatch is now a table keyed on both axes. An unlisted pair is refused with a sentence naming
//    it rather than falling into whichever arm happens to sit lowest in a chain.
//
// 📝 WHY THIS BELONGS IN A UNIT. Declaring a shape is arithmetic on anchors — no device, no window, no
//    frame. The host called it in one place and it never touched anything the host owns.
