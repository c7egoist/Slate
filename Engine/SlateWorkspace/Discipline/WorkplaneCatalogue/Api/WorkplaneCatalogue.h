// 🧩 The planes a workspace has: the three it always had, the ones the artist made, and which one is
//    being drawn on now.
//
// 🔴 THIS UNIT EXISTS BECAUSE A SKETCH HELD EXACTLY ONE PLANE AND FORGOT IT ON EVERY CHANGE.
//    `SketchStructure::DeclarePlane` overwrites. The workplane tool called it, so placing a second plane
//    silently RE-INTERPRETED everything already drawn as lying on the new one — the curves kept their
//    world coordinates, but every measurement, every grid line and every subsequent projection now
//    answered for a surface the geometry was never drawn on. Nothing refused. Nothing warned. The
//    drawing simply stopped meaning what it had meant, which is the "drew in the wrong place" the artist
//    reported.
//
// 🔴 A WORKPLANE IS A THING, NOT A SETTING. The shipped tool wrote a `Folder` record carrying nothing but
//    a NAME, and put the actual plane nowhere. It could not be selected, re-activated, offset, measured
//    against or removed, and reopening the workspace lost it entirely. A plane the artist can make and
//    cannot then USE is a strictly worse arrangement than no tool at all, because it also moves their
//    drawing.
//
// 📝 The arrangement here is the one every parametric sketcher settles on, for the same reason: planes are
//    a NAMED COLLECTION, one of them is ACTIVE, and a sketched curve REMEMBERS which plane it was drawn
//    on. Standing planes are entries in that collection rather than a separate mechanism, so "sketch on
//    the front plane" and "sketch on the one I just placed" are the same act. `WorkplaneStanding` already
//    knows what a plane IS and how to derive one from a click; this unit is where they live and which is
//    current. It computes no geometry of its own.
//
// ⚠️ Activating a plane never moves geometry. Curves are stored in world coordinates and stay exactly
//    where they were put; what changes is only which surface the NEXT thing is drawn on. That is the
//    property the shipped code violated, and `WorkplaneCatalogueProof` pins it.
