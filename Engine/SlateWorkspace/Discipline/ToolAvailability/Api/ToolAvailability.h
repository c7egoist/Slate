// 🧩 What the artist has selected, and therefore which tools may be offered. A closed profile can be
//    extruded and a loose point cannot; a solid can carry a material and a dimension cannot.
//
// 🔴 THE TABLE BELOW WAS A NINE-ARM SWITCH IN THE HOST, ASSIGNING TWELVE FLAGS BY HAND IN EACH ARM. Every
//    arm re-stated which of the twelve it wanted, so an arm that forgot one inherited whatever the reset
//    block above had left — and the reset block and the arms had to agree, in two places, forever. Stating
//    it once per subject as data means a new record subject cannot be added without answering every flag.
//
// 📝 This is a workspace question, not a toolset one. `SketchToolset` knows how to place a rectangle; it
//    does not know that the artist has a solid selected and may therefore be offered a shell operation.
