//============================================================================================================================================
// 🧩 What a constraint is to the viewport: which tool asks for which relationship, what the artist must
//    have selected before it can be applied, where its badge hangs, and what it reads as.
//
// 🔴 THE SELECTION A CONSTRAINT NEEDS IS PART OF WHAT THE CONSTRAINT IS. The host decided it in an
//    `if`-chain that tested the subject and then reached for `.Curve` or `.Point` accordingly — the same
//    shape as the placement defect, where a decision with more than one axis was made on one of them. A
//    constraint needs a specific NUMBER of a specific KIND of thing, and that is a property of the
//    relationship, not of the branch it happened to fall into.
//
// 📝 Stated as a table for the same reason `PlacementCommit`'s is: a subject with no row is refused by
//    name, and adding a relationship means adding a row rather than finding the right `else if` to sit
//    below. `ConstraintAuthoringProof` walks every subject the enumeration declares, so a new one cannot
//    be added without either giving it a row or being told it has none.
//
// ⚠️ This unit declares and reads. It records nothing to a surface and reads no pointer; where a badge
//    hangs is a position it answers, not a thing it draws.
