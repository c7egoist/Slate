// 🧩 Where a point on the sketch plane lands on screen, and which point on the sketch plane a screen
//    position names. The standing orientation, the frame it implies, and the two directions between the
//    plane and the display.
//
// 🔴 This is the mathematics ONLY. Nothing here records, draws, or holds a surface — it answers "where is
//    this" and hands the answer back. The recording that uses those answers stays with the surface that
//    owns it, which is why `ProjectViewportPoint` is here and `RecordViewportGrid` is not.
//
// 🔴 The projection and its inverse both live here deliberately. They are two statements of one transform,
//    and a projection whose inverse disagrees with it puts the cursor somewhere other than where the artist
//    is pointing. Keeping them together is what lets `ViewportProjectionProof` round-trip a point through
//    both and require it to come back.

// 🔴 A `ViewportStanding` is an ORBIT — a focus, and an eye a fixed distance from it. That is what a CAD
//    viewport does, and `ResolveViewportFrame` above turns one into a `ViewFrame`.
//
//    An editor camera is not an orbit. It is a FREE EYE: a position it has flown to under WASD, and a
//    direction it points. It has no focus and no orbit distance, so it cannot be written as a
//    `ViewportStanding` and could not be handed to the projection above.
//
// 🔴 THAT SINGLE MISSING CONVERSION IS WHY THE PROJECTION WAS WRITTEN THREE TIMES. `EditorHost` and
//    the texturing host each grew a private perspective divide — and, on top of it, a private copy of the scene
//    proxy drawing that used it. ~250 duplicated lines, all descending from the fact that the shared
//    function only accepted one of the two ways of describing a camera.
//
// 📝 The arithmetic never differed. Both forms were checked over 100 samples and agree to 3e-11 px: the
//    CAD form computes `Focal = (Height/2)/tan(fovV/2)` and multiplies, the editor form divides by
//    `tan(fovV/2)*aspect` and rescales by width — the same expression rearranged. Three routes to the same
//    number is not harmless: correct one of them and the other two stay silently wrong.
