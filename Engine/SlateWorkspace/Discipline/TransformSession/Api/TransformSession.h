// 🧩 Dragging a selection: what moves, about what, by how much, and how to put it back.
//
// 📝 The KEYBOARD GRAMMAR — which letter starts a move, which restricts an axis, how digits accumulate —
//    is `SlateWorkspace/Discipline/TransformSequence`, lifted at step 10d. This unit is the other half:
//    the geometry the grammar drives. The split is that one reads characters and the other moves points.
//
// 🔴 A SESSION HOLDS THE ORIGINAL POSITIONS AND REPLAYS FROM THEM EVERY FRAME. It does not accumulate a
//    delta onto the live geometry. That is what makes the preview exact — a hundred frames of dragging
//    apply one transform to the starting positions, never a hundred rounding errors on top of each other
//    — and it is what makes cancelling free: put the originals back.
