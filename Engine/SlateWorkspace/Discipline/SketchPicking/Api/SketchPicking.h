// 🧩 What the artist just pointed at, and what moves when they drag it.
//
// 🔴 THE PRIORITY IS THE WHOLE DESIGN. A point, a spline control and a curve can all be within reach of one
//    cursor position, and picking the nearest of the three is wrong: a curve's body passes through every
//    one of its own endpoints, so distance alone would hand back the curve and the artist could never grab
//    the end they were aiming at. The order is POINT, then CONTROL, then CURVE — smallest target first —
//    and each is answered at its own full tolerance rather than competing on distance.
//
// 📝 Everything here is device-free. It reads the sketch and the record directory and answers in world
//    positions; where those land on screen belongs to `ViewportProjection`, and the tolerance the caller
//    passes is the only thing that knows about the view.
