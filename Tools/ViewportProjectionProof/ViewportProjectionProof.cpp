// 🧩 Proves the projection lifted at step 10e, chiefly by ROUND-TRIPPING through it and its inverse.
//
// 🔴 A projection can only be checked properly against its own inverse. Screen coordinates are meaningless
//    on their own — no reader can say whether 412.7 is the right pixel — but "project this point, unproject
//    the result, get the point back" is checkable without knowing anything about the formula, and it fails
//    the moment either direction disagrees with the other. That pairing is what puts a placed point under
//    the cursor rather than a few pixels away from it, and it had never been tested.
//
// 📝 Every orientation is round-tripped in both projections, so a sign error in any one of the seven frames
//    is caught by the arm that uses it rather than by whichever test happened to look.
//
// ⚠️ The bases here are built BY HAND rather than read from a `SketchStructure`. That is deliberate: the
//    projection's behaviour depends on a basis, not on where the basis came from, and linking the whole
//    sketch kernel to obtain one would make this gate fail for reasons that have nothing to do with
//    projection. `ResolveSketchBasis` is the one function here not covered, and it is four lines.

//  §8  An orbit and a free eye describing the same camera project alike
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 🔴 THIS IS THE CLAIM THAT KEEPS THE PROJECTION FROM BEING WRITTEN A FOURTH TIME.
//
//    A `ViewportStanding` is an orbit: a focus and a distance. An editor camera is a free eye: a position
//    it has flown to and a direction it points. Every host that had the second kind and could not express
//    it as the first kind wrote its own projection — `EditorHost` and `PaintHost` both did, and each then
//    wrote its own scene-proxy drawing on top of it. ~250 duplicated lines from one missing conversion.
//
//    `ResolveFreeViewFrame` supplies the conversion. This section demands it is faithful: place a free eye
//    exactly where an orbit puts its eye, point it the same way, and every sample point must land on the
//    same pixel by both routes. If it ever does not, the two descriptions have drifted apart again and the
//    duplication has a reason to come back.
//
// ⚠️ THE TWO CAMERAS HAVE OPPOSITE HANDEDNESS, AND THIS SECTION HAD TO BE CORRECTED TO SAY SO. The first
//    version of §8 demanded the two frames project every point to the same pixel; it failed 20 claims, and
//    the measurement showed why: `Forward` and `Up` agree to the last bit while `Right` is exactly
//    negated. The CAD orbit builds right as `Cross(Forward, Normal)`; the editor camera uses
//    `(cosY, 0, -sinY)`. Neither is wrong — they are two conventions — but they are NOT interchangeable,
//    and a claim that says they are would have been satisfied only by breaking one of the two hosts.
//
// 🔴 SO THE HONEST CLAIM IS NARROWER AND STRONGER: the free frame must be orthonormal, must look where the
//    orbit looks, must share its up, and must mirror it in the horizontal — and, separately and most
//    importantly, must reproduce the SHIPPED host projection to the bit. That last one is what licences
//    deleting the host copies; a claim about matching the orbit never would have.

//    only safe if the replacement gives the SAME ANSWER — not a similar one, and not a better one. A

//    proof afterwards as the recorded definition of what the editor camera means.
//
// 📝 The two look nothing alike on the page: the host divides by `tan(fovV/2) * aspect` and rescales by
//    width, the shared one multiplies by `Focal = (Height/2)/tan(fovV/2)`. They are the same expression
//    rearranged, and the tolerance below is ZERO — not a small number, zero. They agree to the bit.
