// 🧩 Every curve subject must draw, show what shapes it, keep its shape as it grows, land on the
//    workplane, and close on its own endpoint.
//
// 🔴 FIVE INDEPENDENT DEFECTS SHARED ONE SYMPTOM -- "the drawing tools don't work":
//    1. The preview named ONE SUBJECT PER BRANCH, so Hermite, basis spline and NURBS had no branch and
//       drew no feedback at all. All three committed correctly; nothing ever showed it.
//    2. Nothing emitted a marker for an anchor, so a Bezier drew a bare curve with no control points.
//    3. Tessellation was a flat 48 steps whatever the curve's size, and every chord of an approximated
//       arc lies INSIDE the true curve -- so the larger a shape was drawn, the further inside its own
//       outline it was drawn. "The longer the curve, the more it shrinks."
//    4. The polygon commit hardcoded six sides, so the tool drew a hexagon and nothing else.
//    5. `ResolveSketchBasis` asked `Declared()`, which is all-or-nothing over the sketch's CURVES too,
//       so the FIRST shape on a fresh sketch was mapped through the world origin rather than the
//       active workplane -- it drew in mid-air.
//    6. Snapping raced every candidate on raw distance, and the perpendicular foot on a segment is
//       always at least as near as that segment's endpoint, so a polyline could never close on itself.
