// 🧩 Proves that a context menu opens in a free corner and never on top of another widget.
//
// 🔴 THE REQUIREMENT. "Bevel's menu draws bottom-right/left/top, never on top of another widget." The
//    interesting half is the second clause: a menu that usually avoids the widget is not a fix, it is
//    the defect with better odds. So the claims below do not check that the chosen corner looks
//    sensible — they check that the returned box shares NO AREA with anything occupied, across every
//    arrangement the layout allows, including the ones where the answer must be "nowhere".
//
// 🔴 AND REFUSAL IS PART OF THE ANSWER. When every corner is blocked, `PlaceMenuClear` returns false
//    rather than the least-bad overlap. A search that always succeeds cannot be distinguished from one
//    that has quietly given up, so the proof asserts the refusal as hard as it asserts the placements.
