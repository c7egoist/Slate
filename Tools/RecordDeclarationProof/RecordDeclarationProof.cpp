// 🧩 Proves what happens when a sketched thing is written into the workspace directory: which folder it
//    lands in, what it is named, which semantics come with it, and how many undo steps it costs.
//
// 🔴 The claim this file exists to make is that FILING IS NOT ARBITRARY. A curve belongs under Sketch, a
//    dimension under Annotation, and a construction curve is still a curve. Those are decisions a reader
//    can check without knowing anything about the record structure's internals, which is exactly what a
//    proof should assert.
