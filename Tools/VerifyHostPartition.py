"""VerifyHostPartition.py — proves that a host is lifetime and tick only.

`32` §5 states the gate: "Neither host contains engine logic; each is lifetime and tick only." Nothing
enforced it, and the tree drifted to a 5 981-line host holding 138 local function definitions — a library
written inside an executable, reachable from no other host. An agent asked to reuse that behaviour had no
way to, so it wrote its own camera, sky and CAD editor instead.

Four rules are checked:

  ① A host source declares no function beyond main() and its tick helpers.
  ② No file under Application/ implements a solver, tessellator or raster loop.
  ③ Logic is gated with `if constexpr`, not `#ifdef`; the preprocessor guards includes and members only.
  ④ Every .cpp under Application/ is reachable from a declared subject.

    python3 Tools/VerifyHostPartition.py            # warn only, reports and exits 0
    python3 Tools/VerifyHostPartition.py --strict   # refuses, exits 1

The default is deliberate. The debt predates the rule, so the check is introduced measuring rather than
refusing; --strict is turned on by the step that finishes paying it down.
