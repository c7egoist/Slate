// 🧩 Splitting a rectangle around a rectangle: the arithmetic that lets a one-rectangle scissor exclude a box.
//
// 🔴 WHY THIS IS IN FOUNDATION AND NOT BESIDE `PlaneExtent`. The two callers are the GPU passes in
//    `SlateVulkan`, and `SlateVulkan` requires `SlateMath` alone — deliberately, so nothing device-side
//    can name an interface type. `PlaneExtent` lives in `SlateUI`, so stating the boxes in its terms
//    would have quietly inverted that dependency. The arithmetic is pure numbers and belongs to no
//    layer, so it sits here and both sides convert at the edge.
